# Session 1: Python programming language

In this session you will learn the basic elements in the python language:

- Comments: to add text inside a code cell, you must comment it using a hash (#) for a single line or three quotes ("""...""") for docstrings. Comments will not be run as code, and they are really helpful for following the code.
- Data types:
  - String: text is passed as a string (str) in python, always inside single ('...') or double quotes ("...")
  - Numbers:
    - Integers (int): whole numbers (positive or negative)
    - Floating Point Numbers (float): real numbers with decimal positions
  - Booleans: a boolean (bool) value is either a True or False 
  - Lists: a list is an ordered collection of items which can include different data types inside. Each item in a list is recognized by its position. Keep in mind that lists start at position 0 in python, not 1. A list is defined by square brackets [1,2,2,3] 
  - Sets: A set is an unordered collection of unique items. It is defined by curly brackets {1,2,3} 
  - Dictionaries: A dictionary is an unordered conatiner of Key:Value pairs. Keys must be unique, and can map to one or more values. A dictionary is defined by curly brackets {Key:Value}, for example {"Name":"Gemma", "Age":30}

- Variables: a variable stores data values, and its name must be UNIQUE. Variables are simply assigned by the “=” operator, and can be reassigned at any moment. 
- Conditionals: The usual conditions in mathematics like <, >, ==, <=, >= are used in Python. “If… else” statements are also used as conditionals in Python. The way conditions work is, if a condition is true, a block of code should be executed. 
- Loops: loops are used to go over a piece of code multiple times. There are for loops and while loops. 
- List comprehensions: list comprehensions are shorter lines of code used to create lists based on an existing list. 
- Functions: writing functions is a way to create reusable code. After writing the code, you only need to ‘call’ it when you want to use it and not write it again.
